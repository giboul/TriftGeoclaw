# TriftGeoclaw
An attempt to quantify the potential of impulse waves induced by snow avalanches in the future [Trift reservoir](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313646761_L'amenagement_hydroelectrique_de_Trift) (Gadmen, Bern, Switerland).

This work is divided in three parts which are all base on David George's [Geoclaw](https://www.clawpack.org/geoclaw) module from [Clawpack](https://www.clawpack.org/).

# 1. Avalanches: [AVAC](https://github.com/giboul/TriftGeoclaw/blob/main/AVAC/README.md)

This part is copied from Christophe Ancey's (cancey) work on avalanches, see his [AVAC](https://github.com/cancey/avac.git) repo.

# 2. Momentum transfer from avalanche to water: [FLUME](https://github.com/giboul/TriftGeoclaw/blob/main/Flume/README.md)

This is also from Christophe Ancey's GitHub: [Flume](https://github.com/cancey/hydraulics/tree/main/Floods/Flume)

# 3. Wave modelling: [Tsunami](https://github.com/giboul/TriftGeoclaw/blob/main/Tsunami/README.md)

Here, David George's [Geoclaw](https://www.clawpack.org/geoclaw) covers everything.
